# Cookie Generator

This simple web app generates a random "cookie" recipe using JavaScript's math object.

The first five ingredients (butter, sugar, flour, baking soda, and eggs) are essential cookie ingredients and are thus guaranteed to be in the recipe, although their amounts may be 0.

The next five ingredients are randomly selected from a large list. For clarity of code and ease of modification, the list of additives is stored in the `additives.js` file and imported by the main module. As a simple text list, the additives can be modified without any special coding skills by appending a new item in single-quotes.

## Developer Notes

This was one of my earliest projects. As I continue learning JavaScript, I like to return here occasionally to improve the code. It's short and simple, so refactoring takes just a few minutes and can be a satisfying way to take a breather from larger projects. I don't update it super often, so it might not represent my present abilities, but you can look at the commit history to see how my skills have improved over time.
