# Cookie Generator

This simple web app generates a random "cookie" recipe using JavaScript's math object.

The first five ingredients (butter, sugar, flour, baking soda, and eggs) are essential cookie ingredients and are thus guaranteed to be in the recipe, although their amounts may be 0.

The next five ingredients are randomly selected from a list that appears in the `cookiegen.js` file. For ease of use, the `ingredients` folder contains a txt file and a Python script. You can modify the txt file to add or remove ingredients. The Python script will print the items from the file in proper Javascript list syntax which can be pasted into `cookiegen.js`.
