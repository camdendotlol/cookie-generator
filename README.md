# Cookie Generator

https://mythmakerseven.github.io/cookie-generator/

This simple web app generates a random "cookie" recipe using JavaScript's math object.

The first five ingredients (butter, sugar, flour, baking soda, and eggs) are essential cookie ingredients and are thus guaranteed to be in the recipe, although their amounts may be 0.

The next five ingredients are randomly selected from a list that appears in the `cookiegen.js` file. For ease of modification, the ingredients folder contains a txt file and a Python script. After updating the txt file, the Python script will print its items in proper Javascript array syntax which can be pasted into `cookiegen.js`.
